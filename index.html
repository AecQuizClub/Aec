            it finds a proper place in the digital world in the form of this website. Throughout the years, AECQC
            incessantly strived and laboured to uphold and promote the culture of quizzing and also improving the
            standard of quizzing in this quest. The memories of AECQC need to be well-documented as it will ensure that
            the hearts of future AECQC members brim with inspiration and zeal. The stories of our successes - both as
            organizers and participants will push them to unmatched triumphs and achievements. The creation of this
            website is a serious effort on the part of the 2021-22 Core team to chronicle and preserve the legacy of
            this illustrious club.
